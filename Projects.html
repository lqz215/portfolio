      <h3>Project</h3>
      <h4>Heart Valve</h4>
      <p>Course: Introduction to Engineering Design</p>
    <p>Date: 3/9/18-3/30/18</p>
    <p>Objective: To design a one way non-return heart valve for future patient</p>
    <p>The goal of this project is to design a new type of one way non-return 
    heart valve project. Our team had a meeting with our clients, who are the 
    members of the bio-medical team, to discuss the purpose of the heart valve 
    that has already on the market and problems they have. The two important
    constraints of the heart valve is preventing the blood from flowing 
    backwards and maximizing the quantity of blood flow. n this project, I 
    learned how to make advanced modeling in the inventor. Now I've understood 
    the association between the toughness and the thickness, which let me know 
    how should I balance these two variable. The most valuable skill I've gained
    in this project is that I've learnt how to communicate with other team 
    member and how to lead the team effectively. As the team leader, I kept 
    tracking our clients' demands and introducing our new idea of design to 
    them. The whole project was going very well in a highly effective way. 
    I also knew how to express the idea clearly and make a sketch of the product
    that showed its function. This project was a big step for me.</p>

      <h3>Project</h3>
      <h4>Entrepreneur Project</h4>
      <p>Course: Introduction to Engineering Design</p>
      <p>Date: 5/11/18-5/21/18</p>
      <p>Objective: To design a new toothpaste tube in order to minimize the 
      waste and protect the environment.</p>
      <p>Every year, company like Colgate pays millions of dollar to the 
      government all around the world. For what? For the extra sewing fee for 
      producing toxic water just because of making plastic tube for their 
      toothpaste. So, our basic idea is to make a syringe for the toothpaste. 
      This idea would consist three parts of design: the Tube, the Container, 
      and the Pusher. The core of this design is to cooperate with those 
      toothpaste company to let them produce their toothpastes in our newly 
      designed container that is made by paper. As the team designer, I really 
      practiced my brainstorming ability in this project. Also, I improved a lot 
      on using inventor.</p>
