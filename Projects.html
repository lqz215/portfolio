      <h3>Project</h3>
      <h4>Heart Valve</h4>
      <p>Course: Introduction to Engineering Design</p>
    <p>Date: 3/9/18-3/30/18</p>
    <p>Objective: To design a one way non-return heart valve for future patient</p>
    <p>The goal of this project is to design a new type of one way non-return 
    heart valve project. Our team had a meeting with our clients, who are the 
    members of the bio-medical team, to discuss the purpose of the heart valve 
    that has already on the market and problems they have. The two important
    constraints of the heart valve is preventing the blood from flowing 
    backwards and maximizing the quantity of blood flow. n this project, I 
    learned how to make advanced modeling in the inventor. Now I've understood 
    the association between the toughness and the thickness, which let me know 
    how should I balance these two variable. The most valuable skill I've gained
    in this project is that I've learnt how to communicate with other team 
    member and how to lead the team effectively. As the team leader, I kept 
    tracking our clients' demands and introducing our new idea of design to 
    them. The whole project was going very well in a highly effective way. 
    I also knew how to express the idea clearly and make a sketch of the product
    that showed its function. This project was a big step for me.</p>

      <h3>Project</h3>
      <h4>Entrepreneur Project</h4>
      <p>Course: Introduction to Engineering Design</p>
      <p>Date: 5/11/18-5/21/18</p>
      <p>Objective: To design a new toothpaste tube in order to minimize the 
      waste and protect the environment.</p>
      <p>Every year, company like Colgate pays millions of dollar to the 
      government all around the world. For what? For the extra sewing fee for 
      producing toxic water just because of making plastic tube for their 
      toothpaste. So, our basic idea is to make a syringe for the toothpaste. 
      This idea would consist three parts of design: the Tube, the Container, 
      and the Pusher. The core of this design is to cooperate with those 
      toothpaste company to let them produce their toothpastes in our newly 
      designed container that is made by paper. As the team designer, I really 
      practiced my brainstorming ability in this project. Also, I improved a lot 
      on using inventor.</p>

      <h3>Project</h3>
      <h4>Text Adventure Project</h4>
      <p>Course: Computer Science Principle</p>
      <p>Date: 5/11/18-5/21/18</p>
      <p>Objective: To create a story which the readers get to have their 
      choices that can affect the storyline.</p>
      <p>During this text adventure project, we used some interesting decision 
      variables to keep people stay in track, We also try to shorten the 
      plotline to avoid useless variables. We keep in mind that we need to make 
      sure that the player can decide the end of the story. During the coding 
      we put some easter eggs in the code. For example, if you enter something 
      other than a 1, 2, or e in the first decision it the system will say 
      that you fell off from the chair. I heard some game company also put some 
      easter egg in their game to boost their game culture. Also, during the 
      coding process, we try to make the code to be user-proof, which means 
      debug as many errors as we can to prevent them from breaking our code. 
      In this project, I started to know the logical principle of the python 
      function. Whatsmore, in this project, I made lots of effort to organize 
      my indentation and function format. This project is really a important 
      step for me in the engineering.</p>

      <h3>Project</h3>
      <h4>Image manipulation Project</h4>
      <p>Course: Computer Science Principle</p>
      <p>Date: 03/04/2019-03/25/2019</p>
      <p>Objective: To design a series of images that met clients' requirement.
      </p>
      <p>In this project, we were doing a series of car advertising poster by
      adding logos and changing color theme to create a old fashion mood. By 
      letting my partner write the docstring and determine the topic helped the 
      team work well, while I was coding the project. my partner can sometimes 
      point out the error made My partner also tested our code. Most of the 
      time, my partner tested out my code and pointed out errors, which I was 
      able to address and fix as needed. Our team dynamic was getting better 
      than the first time, as my partner constantly gave me feedback on my code,
      and updated me on what I had to fix. From this project, I get to fully 
      understand about how to manipulate a image and the principle idea of 
      masking. Also, this project really improved my ability in writing a 
      well-organized, detailed documentation.</p>
