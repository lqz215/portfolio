    <p>The goal of this project is to design a new type of one way non-return 
    heart valve project. Our team had a meeting with our clients, who are the 
    members of the bio-medical team, to discuss the purpose of the heart valve 
    that has already on the market and problems they have. The two important 
    constraints of the heart valve is preventing the blood from flowing 
    backwards and maximizing the quantity of blood flow. We designed a heart 
    valve that has a lift-slide blocker in it. When the blood comes in, the 
    blocker would slide down until it's blocked by the little pump that is at 
    the edge of the valve, the blood would flow through the gap between the 
    blocker and the valve. When the blood flow backwards, the blood would push 
    the blocker up and block the whole heart valve. This is a very simple and 
    economy design which has only two parts and could help patients' hearts to 
    work properly.

    <p>In this project, I learned how to make advanced modeling in the inventor.
    Now I've understood the association between the toughness and the thickness,
    which let me know how should I balance these two variable. The most valuable
    skill I've gained in this project is that I've learnt how to communicate 
    with other team member and how to lead the team effectively. As the team 
    leader, I kept tracking our clients' demands and introducing our new idea 
    of design to them. The whole project was going very well in a highly 
    effective way. I also knew how to express the idea clearly and make a sketch
    of the product that showed its function. This project was a big step for me.
