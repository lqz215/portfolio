    <p>Hi, my name is Qingzhe Lin, you can also call me Tony. I'm an energetic
    Junior student of Dublin High School in Dublin, CA. My personal career 
    plan is to become a engineer that works on Aircraft Flight Control System.
    This system is one of the most important and complex systems on an aircraft
    and it's also the key which makes planes fly safely. To achieve my goal,
    I plan to go to a notable university and get a Bachelor of Science degree 
    in computer science. I also plan to get the certificate from Federal
    Aviation Administration. Working with aircraft has been my dream since I 
    was a child.
    </p> 
    <p>I was a member of Shanghai Foreign Language School Science
    Club. We had a lot of competitions with other schools every year, including
    modeling market expansion, making innovations and improvements on certain
    products and advertising on the latest products. These experience have
    helped me develop problem-solving skills and made me more open-minded. 
    Especially the advertising part, which made me become a very persuasive
    person. I'm also a native Chinese speaker, this would be a great advantage 
    in international businesses.
    </p>
    <p>Engineering the Aircraft Flight Control System is required a very strong 
    technical problem-solving skill and and problem-defining skill, which I have 
    gained a lot from my previous experience. I believe my efforts and passions 
    would make me a great addition to any company. Thanks for taking time to read
    my introduction. You can also check my other information in the rest of my 
    sites. </p>
